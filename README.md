This is an android app for plotting the "tuning curve" of a musical instrument (specially, clarinet).
Contrary to many other tuning apps, this one focuses on showing the evolution of tuning over a short amount of time
(a few seconds), in order to study and practice stability of sounds and also compensate for th epitch lowering phenomenom
that can be observed in clarinet, due to change in air density (CO2 proportion).

This is just a skeleton for the code: it is far from complete for now.
Please come on later on if you are interested.
